# Mushroom_Classification_ML üçÑ

### Project Objective 
The goal is to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their features such as cap shape, cap color, and gill color.
A real-world dataset from Kaggle is used for this purpose.

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration 
Dataset is loaded using Pandas and explored using methods like head(), tail(), shape, and info().
Target variable (class) has two values: e (edible) and p (poisonous).
Checked for null values (none found) and examined column statistics using describe().

### 2. Data Preprocessing 
Categorical data is converted to numerical format using Label Encoding.
Features are stored in X (independent variables) and the target variable in y (dependent variable).

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA 
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is applied to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining 85% of the original information.
This helps optimize model training by reducing computational costs.

### 4. Train-Test Split 
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split from sklearn.

### 5. Model Training 
Multiple machine learning models are trained, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

### 6. Model Evaluation 
Models are evaluated using the accuracy_score metric.
Performance comparison helps identify the best model for the task.

### 7. Model Saving and Prediction 
The best-performing model (Random Forest) is retrained on the entire dataset and saved using joblib.
Demonstrated in my Pythob code how to use the saved model to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

### 8. GUI Implementation 
A GUI is created using (tkinter library) to allow users to input mushroom features and get classification results in real-time.

# CONCLUSION

### Why Random Forest Performed Best in Mushroom Classification:
1. Categorical Features and Relationships:
The mushroom dataset consists of multiple categorical features with meaningful relationships (e.g., cap shape, gill color).
Random Forest excels at handling such features due to its ability to split data based on feature importance.

2. Complex Patterns:
The mushroom dataset likely contains non-linear and hierarchical patterns. Random Forest can capture these complexities better than simpler models like Logistic Regression or SVM.

3. Balanced Dataset:
If the target variable (edible/poisonous) is relatively balanced, Random Forest can effectively utilize its ensemble approach to classify accurately without being biased toward one class.

4. Robustness Against Noise:
Random Forest is less sensitive to noisy data compared to single models, which ensures higher accuracy on test data.

5. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:
PCA reduced the dataset to 7 principal components while retaining 85% of the information. This simplification likely reduced computational complexity and helped Random Forest focus on key patterns.
